# DCEGChallenge

Hosted on Github Pages: https://anthonyxiang1.github.io/DCEGChallenge/

For my solution, I used Javascript, Plotly.js to create visualizations and Github Pages to host on the web. I took about 7 hours on the challenge - I was determined to learn how to create an interactive plot and got carried away with time.

Plots included are:
Two stacked barplots to show number of cancer diagnoses by gender and by race.
A violin plot of cancer types and their cost distributions.
A heatmap to show correlation of age groups with certain cancer diagnoses.
An interactive boxplot of mortality risks and their cost distributions.

I had an issue working with the app token, and wasn't sure of how to include it in my code. Furthermore, the heatmap is blocked by client on Github Pages, but does show locally. (Is this related to the app token restrictions?)
